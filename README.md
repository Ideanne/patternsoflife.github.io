# Patterns of Life website

## About this repository

This repository contains the Dutch pages for the
[Patterns of Life](https://www.patternsoflife.nl/) website, and some
shared assets for the site as a whole.

The entire website is generated out of three repositories:

- this repository: dutch pages and large shared assets
- [patternsoflife/en](https://github.com/patternsoflife/en): english pages
- [patternsoflife/pages-theme](https://github.com/patternsoflife/pages-theme): theme files and small shared assets


## About GitHub Pages

You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/redesigningpsychiatry/pol-pages/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
